#Setup

In a video call, [Árni Björnsson](https://fabacademy.org/2022/labs/isafjordur/students/arni-bjornsson/) showed Móses and me how to set up MkDocs and Git. I've summarized all the steps here, with a few extra resources I found along the way:

##MkDocs setup from scratch
First, I installed the [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) code editor.

Then, as [Árni Björnsson](https://fabacademy.org/2022/labs/isafjordur/students/arni-bjornsson/) suggested, I created a folder called `code` directly in my C: drive, so that Dropbox and OneDrive don't try to sync the folder and mess up my GitHub connection.

I followed [this tutorial](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/installation/) to set up MkDocs. There are a few steps to it:

1. It starts with installing the [Python extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python).
3. The `pip` package manager is included with the Python extension, but for some reason you don't always get the latest version. It may be a good idea to check the version. I opened a new terminal in the top menu in VSCode (`Terminal -> New Terminal`) and typed 
```
pip --version
pip 22.3.1 from C:\Users\your_username\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\lib\site-packages\pip (python 3.10)
```
and if it says it's out of date you can upgrade pip like this:
```
pip install --upgrade pip

```
2. Now it was time to install MkDocs:
```
pip install mkdocs
```
3. Then, as the tutorial suggests, I typed `mkdocs --version` to see if the installation went OK:
```
mkdocs --version
mkdocs, version 1.2.0 from /usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mkdocs (Python 3.8)
```
4. (optional) I also installed the [Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme because it seemed nice and it includes expandable code annotations:
```
pip install mkdocs-material
```

!!! note
    To enable notes like this one in MkDocs, I added [Admonitions](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/) to the extensions in the mkdocs.yml file:
    ```yaml
    markdown_extensions:
        admonition
    ```
    Then, to create a note, start with `!!! note` and then indent the note text:
    ```
    !!! note
        Note text
    ```


### MkDocs test drive
I followed this [tutorial](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/creating-your-site/) to set up a small test website and get a live preview. 

1. After [installing](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/) Material for MkDocs, I made a folder called Mkdocs. Then I opened a terminal and made sure that it was in the right folder:
```
cd C:\code\Mkdocs
```
Then I simply typed
```
mkdocs new .
```
and that was enough to create a simple site! Well, there are a few extra steps to view the site and deploy it, but this whole process is very simple.
2. Then I added the following lines to mkdocs.yml:
```yaml
theme:
  name: material
```
This is geared towards the Material theme for MkDocs, so if you're using a different theme, the only thing you need to change is the the theme line in the mkdocs.yml file.
3. Set up autocomplete. The [tutorial](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/creating-your-site/) suggests adding a line to settings.json, but it doesn't mention where that file is in VSCode. But it does provide a [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings) to instructions. You go into `File -> Preferences -> Settings`, scroll all the way down to Yaml: Schemas, and click `Edit in settings.json`. ![Image](./images/schemas.png) Then you add the line `"https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/schema.json": "mkdocs.yml"`, so in the end it looks like this:
``` yaml
{
    "workbench.colorTheme": "Default Dark+",
    "files.autoSave": "afterDelay",
    "yaml.schemas": {
        
        "https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/schema.json": "mkdocs.yml"
    }
}
```
4. OK, now we're yearning for something to happen. Type the following into the terminal:
```
mkdocs serve
```
Now open your browser and write [localhost:8000](localhost:8000) in the address bar. Voilá! We have a live preview for an MkDocs website!

![Material theme](./images/material.png)

The source code for this site, written in Markdown, looks like this:

```
# Welcome to MkDocs

For full documentation visit [mkdocs.org](https://www.mkdocs.org).

## Commands

* `mkdocs new [dir-name]` - Create a new project.
* `mkdocs serve` - Start the live-reloading docs server.
* `mkdocs build` - Build the documentation site.
* `mkdocs -h` - Print help message and exit.

## Project layout

    mkdocs.yml    # The configuration file.
    docs/
        index.md  # The documentation homepage.
        ...       # Other markdown pages, images and other files.
```
As you can see, Markdown is simple and readable. Writing `#` gives you the biggest heading, `##` gives you heading 2, and so on. Put `*` in front of text to make a bullet point. To add a link, you do this: `[mkdocs.org](https://www.mkdocs.org)` and to add an image you do the same, but with an exclamation mark: `![Material theme](./images/material.png)`
5. Finally, to build a static site, write this in the terminal:
```
mkdocs build
```
I tried this and got an index page that works fine. But when I clicked the Setup page (this page) I got this:
![Setup error](./images/setup_error.png)
Hm. Apparently you need to put the structure of the site into your `mkdocs.yml` file to explicitly state the site navigation. So I opened it up and added
```
  nav:
    - 'index.md'
    - 'code.md'     # The code page is just a few code block tests in different languages.
    - 'setup.md'
```
No, that didn't work either. After some looking around I found a [solution](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/2191). I added the following line to `mkdocs.yml`:
```
use_directory_urls: false
```
It works! And the first solution is unnecessary; MkDocs will infer the site navigation based on the pages you create in the docs folder.

Setting up MkDocs and getting the live preview working took me an hour in the morning. Writing up how I did it took me the rest of the day. It was a great way to learn Markdown. I like Markdown, with one exception; I don't have the ` symbol on my keyboard. I need to use that quite a lot for code snippets. Now this page and its source code serve as my reference in writing documentation. On any page, click the document icon in the footer to open its source code. I used the 

!!! note
    To enable code highlighting (coloring the code, similar to how it looks in the VSCode editor), I added the following lines to `mkdocs.yml`:
    ```
    markdown_extensions:
    - pymdownx.highlight:
        anchor_linenums: true
    - pymdownx.inlinehilite
    - pymdownx.snippets
    - pymdownx.superfences
    - pymdownx.details
    ```
    I'm not sure if all these lines are necessary, but I'm just following this [tutorial](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/code-blocks/). The last line comes from somewhere else, I don't remember where. Anyway, now I can make a code block by enclosing the code with ``` at the top and bottom and including the name of the language at the top:
    ```
        ```python
        # This program prints Hello, world!
        print('Hello, world!')
        ```
    ```
    This results in:
    ```python
    # This program prints Hello, world!
    print('Hello, world!')
    ```
    You can use this [reference](https://support.codebasehq.com/articles/tips-tricks/syntax-highlighting-in-markdown) to write the name of the programming language correctly at the top of your code block.

One more thing, I also added
``` yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - attr_list
  - md_in_html
```
to add the ability to align images, add captions and mark large images for lazy loading, as per this [tutorial](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/images/).

## Customizing the theme

There is a way to toggle between light and dark mode. [This tutorial](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/changing-the-colors/#color-palette-toggle) says that it's enough to copy the following code into `mkdocs.yml`:
=== "Light/dark toggle"
    ``` yaml
    theme:
        palette: 

        # Palette toggle for light mode
        - scheme: default
          toggle:
            icon: material/brightness-7 
            name: Switch to dark mode

        # Palette toggle for dark mode
        - scheme: slate
          toggle:
            icon: material/brightness-4
            name: Switch to light mode
    ```
=== "Light/dark toggle + Color change"
    ``` yaml
    theme:
        palette: 

        # Palette toggle for light mode
        - scheme: default
          toggle:
            icon: material/brightness-7 
            name: Switch to dark mode
          primary: deep orange
          accent: deep orange

        # Palette toggle for dark mode
        - scheme: slate
          toggle:
            icon: material/brightness-4
            name: Switch to light mode
         primary: deep orange
          accent: deep orange
    ```
``` title="Source code for the content tabs above"
    === "Light/dark toggle"
        ``` yaml
        theme:
            palette: 

            # Palette toggle for light mode
            - scheme: default
            toggle:
            icon: material/brightness-7 
                name: Switch to dark mode

            # Palette toggle for dark mode
            - scheme: slate
            toggle:
                icon: material/brightness-4
            name: Switch to light mode
        ```
    === "Light/dark toggle + Color change"
        ``` yaml
        palette: 

            # Palette toggle for light mode
            - scheme: default
            toggle:
                icon: material/brightness-7 
                name: Switch to dark mode
            primary: deep orange
            accent: deep orange

            # Palette toggle for dark mode
            - scheme: slate
            toggle:
                icon: material/brightness-4
                name: Switch to light mode
            primary: deep orange
            accent: deep orange
        ```
```
!!! note
    How to enable content tabs in `mkdocs.yaml`:
    ``` yaml
    markdown_extensions:
    - pymdownx.superfences
    - pymdownx.tabbed:
          alternate_style: true 
    ```
I also discovered that if you select a command, right click and select Change All Occurrences in VSCode, you only need to write the new color once, instead of four times. Nice!
Finally, I made a logo in Inkscape. I designed this logo in grade school, it's a kind of Icelandic rune that combines my initials S and K. Then I added two lines to `mkdocs.yml` to change the logo in the top left corner and also the favicon (the icon you see in the browser tab).
``` yaml
theme:
  logo: images\SK_logo.svg
  favicon: images\SK_logo.svg
```
First I wrote the path as `/images/SK_logo.SVG` and VSCode complained about the formatting. I found that you can right click the image and select Copy Relative Path to get the right formatting. That gave me `docs\images\SK_logo.svg`, which didn't work, but when I changed it to `images\SK_logo.svg` it worked.
I also enabled two [navigation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-navigation/) options:
``` yaml
theme:
  features:
    - navigation.instant    # Instant loading (page behaves like a single-page application, search persists between pages)
    - navigation.tabs       # The pages are visible as tabs at the top instead of on the left hand side.
```

##GitHub setup
To set up a GitHub connection, I installed the [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/github).
